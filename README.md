    email VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    hashed_password VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR NOT NULL,  -- 'manager' or 'employee'

```

## üîß API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login (returns JWT token)
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user information

### Users
- `GET /api/users/team` - Get team members (managers only)

### Feedback
- `POST /api/feedback` - Create new feedback (managers only)
- `GET /api/feedback/given` - Get feedback given by manager
- `GET /api/feedback/received` - Get feedback received by employee
- `PUT /api/feedback/{id}` - Update feedback (managers only)
